# Dialogist

> Soundboard for the new age of intertubes

## Running

Built using the magical [go](https://golang.org), so you just need to run `go get github.com/TxSSC/dialogist` to be up and running. Ensure you have your `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH` variable to run the binary, and start it with `dialogist`.

## Configuration

Fill up your `ClipPath` directory with all the **mp3** that you would like served on the soundboard.

#### ClipPath

The relative directory to the binary for serving sound clips.
